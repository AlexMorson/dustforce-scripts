## Editor Plugins

A collection of plugins designed to enhance the dustforce level editor.
* `editor_toolbar.as` contains functionality to add new tabs to the level editor, and must be enabled for the other plugins to work.
* `prop_tool.as` adds a tool under the prop tab that is used to move, rotate and delete individual props with left, middle and right click respectively. Pressing `Q` also toggles the tool on/off.
* `set_spawn.as` adds a tool under the entities tab specifically for setting the player spawn. Pressing `E` toggles the tool on/off.

### Installation

1. Copy **lib** from [cmann1/DustScripts](https://github.com/cmann1/DustScripts) into your **script_src** directory.

## Maps

Scripts for some of the maps I have made, as well as the embedded content (images and sounds) used in them.
